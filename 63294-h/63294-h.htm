as nothing.</p>
<p align="center">HIST. D'UNE AME, CH. VIII</p>
<br>
<p><font size="+3">O</font>NE evening, at a loss for words to tell Jesus how
I loved Him and how much I wished that He might be everywhere served and
glorified, I reflected with pain that not one act of love would ever mount
upwards from out of the depths of hell. Then I cried out that willingly would
I consent to see myself plunged into that place of torment and blasphemy, in
order that He might be loved there eternally. That could not really glorify
Him since He desires only our happiness, but love makes one want to say a
thousand foolish things. If I spoke thus, it was not that I did not long for
heaven; but then, my heaven was none other than <i>Love</i>, and in my
fervour I felt that nothing could separate me from the Divine object of my
love. . .</p>
<p align="center">HIST. D'UNE AME, CH. V</p>
<br>
<p><font size="+3">S</font>EEING the eternal recompense so disproportionate
to the trifling sacrifices of this life, I longed to love Jesus, to love Him
ardently, to give Him a thousand proofs of tenderness while yet I could do
so. . .</p>
<p align="center">HIST. D'UNE AME, CH. V</p>
<br>
<p><font size="+3">T</font>HE love of God reveals itself in the very simplest
soul who resists His grace in nothing, as well as in the most sublime.
Indeed, the characteristic of love being to humble itself, if all souls
resembled those of the holy Doctors who have enlightened the Church, the good
God would not seem to descend low enough in coming to them. But He has
created the infant who knows nothing and can only wail; He has created the
poor savage who has but the natural law for guidance, and it is even unto
their hearts that He deigns to stoop.</p>
<p align="center">HIST. D'UNE AME, CH. I
</p>
<br>
<p><font size="+3">I</font>N order that Love may be fully satisfied it must
needs stoop to very nothingness and transform that nothing into fire.</p>
<p align="center">HIST. D'UNE AME, CH. XI</p>
<br>
<p><font size="+3">I</font>N times of aridity when I am incapable of praying,
of practising virtue, I seek little opportunities, mere trifles, to give
pleasure to Jesus; for instance a smile, a pleasant word when inclined to be
silent and to show weariness. If I find no opportunities, I at least tell Him
again and again that I love Him; that is not difficult and it keeps alive the
fire in my heart. Even though this fire of love might seem to me extinct I
would still throw little straws upon the embers and I am certain it would
rekindle.</p>
<p align="center">XVI LETTER TO HER SISTER C&#201;LINE</p>
<br>
<p><font size="+3">O</font>N <i>the day of my conversion</i> Charity entered
into my heart and with it a yearning to forget self always; thenceforward I
was happy.</p>
<p align="center">HIST. D'UNE AME, CH. V</p>
<br>
<p><font size="+3">I</font> DO not will that creatures should possess a
single atom of my love; I wish to give all to Jesus, since He makes me
understand that He alone is perfect happiness. All shall be for Him, all! And
even when I have nothing to offer Him I will give Him that nothing.</p>

<br>
<p><font size="+3">I</font> KNOW of one means only by which to attain to
perfection: LOVE. Let us love, since our heart is made for nothing else.
Sometimes I seek another word to express Love, but in this land of exile
<i>the word which begins and ends</i> <a href="#1-2">[2]</a> is quite
incapable of rendering the vibrations of the soul; we must then adhere to
this simple and only word: TO LOVE.
</p><p>
But on whom shall our poor heart lavish its love? Who shall be found that is
great enough to be the recipient of its treasures? Will a human being know
how to comprehend them, and above all will he be able to repay? There exists
but one Being capable of comprehending love; it is Jesus; He alone can give
us back infinitely more than we shall ever give to Him.</p>

<br>
<p><font size="+3">I</font> HAVE no longer any desire unless it be to love

<p class="indent">
In the inmost cellar
<br>

Of my Beloved have I drunk; and when I went forth<br>
Over all the plain<br>
I knew nothing,<br>
And lost the flock I followed before.<br>
My soul is occupied<br>
And all my substance in His service;<br>
Now I guard no flock,<br>
Nor have I any other employment:<br>
My sole occupation is love.
</p><p class="indent">
(<i>Spiritual Canticle, Trans. D. Lewis.</i>)</p>
<p align="center">HIST. D'UNE AME, CH. VIII</p>
<br>
<p><font size="+3">O</font>H! if souls weak and imperfect as mine, felt what
I feel, not one would despair of reaching the summit of the mountain of Love,
since Jesus does not demand from us great deeds, but only self-surrender and
gratitude.
</p><p>
<i>I have no need,</i> saith He, <i>of the goats of thy flocks . . . If I
were hungry I would not tell thee . . . Offer unto God the sacrifice of
praise and thanksgiving.</i> <a href="#1-3">[3]</a>
</p><p>
See then, all that Jesus asks of us! He has not need of our works but only of
our <i>love</i>. This very God who declares that He needs not to tell us if
He were hungry, did not hesitate to <i>beg</i> of the Samaritan woman a
little water . . . He thirsted!!! But in saying: "<i>Give me to drink</i>,"
<a href="#1-4">[4]</a> it was the love of His poor creature that the Creator
of the universe besought. He thirsted for Love!
</p><p>
And now, more than ever is Jesus athirst. He meets with none but the
ungrateful and the indifferent among the disciples of the world; and amongst
<i>His own</i> disciples He finds, alas! very few hearts that surrender
themselves without any reserve to the tenderness of His infinite Love.</p>
<p align="center">HIST. D'UNE AME, CH. XI</p>
<p>
<a name="1-3">[3]</a> <i>Cf.</i> Ps. xlix, 9, 12, 14. <br>
<a name="1-4">[4]</a> John, iv, 7.</p>
<br>
<p class="indent">Since ever I have known Love's mighty power <br>
Thus hath it wrought its work within my soul&mdash;<br>
Whate'er it findeth there, or good or ill, <br>
It turneth all to gain; its living flame <br>
Transforms my soul into its very self. <a href="#1-5">[5]</a></p>

<br>
<p><font size="+3">H</font>OW sweet is the way of Love! True, one may fall,
one may not be always faithful, but Love, knowing how to draw profit from
all, very quickly consumes whatsoever may displease Jesus, leaving naught but
humble and profound peace in the innermost soul.</p>
<p align="center">HIST. D'UNE AME, CH. VIII</p>
<br>
<p><font size="+3">T</font>HINKING one day of those who offer themselves as
victims to the Justice of God in order to turn aside the punishment reserved
for sinners by taking it upon themselves, I felt this offering to be noble
and generous, but I was far from feeling moved to make it.
</p><p>
"O my Divine Master," I cried in the depths of my heart, "shall Thy Justice
alone receive victims of holocaust? Has not Thy Merciful Love also need of
them? On all sides it is ignored, rejected . . . the hearts on which Thou
wouldst lavish it turn to creatures, seeking happiness in miserable and
fleeting affections instead of casting themselves into Thine arms, into the
ineffable furnace of Thine Infinite Love.
</p><p>
"O my God, must Thy Love&mdash;disdained&mdash;remain within Thy Heart?
Methinks that if Thou shouldst find souls offering themselves as victims of
holocaust to Thy Love, Thou wouldst consume them rapidly; that Thou wouldst
be glad not to restrict the flames of infinite tenderness pent up within
Thee.
</p><p>
"If Thy Justice&mdash;the Justice which Thou dost exercise on earth&mdash;be
pleased to find voluntary victims on which to discharge its weight, how much
the more must Thy Merciful Love also desire its victims, since <i>Thy Mercy
reacheth even to heaven</i>. <a href="#1-6">[6]</a>
</p><p>
"O Jesus, that happily I may be that holocaust consume Thy little victim in
the fire of Divine Love."</p>

<br>
<p><font size="+3">A</font>H! since that day love penetrates me and surrounds
me; this <i>Merciful Love</i> each moment renews and purifies me, leaving in
my heart no trace of sin. No, I cannot fear Purgatory; I know that I do not
merit even to enter with the Holy Souls into that place of expiation, but I
know too that the fire of Love is more sanctifying than the fire of
Purgatory, I know that Jesus cannot will needless suffering for us, and that
He would not inspire me with the desires I feel if He were unwilling to
fulfil them.</p>
<p align="center">HIST. D'UNE AME, CH. VIII</p>
<br>
<p><font size="+3">T</font>O offer oneself as a Victim to Divine Love is not
to offer oneself to sweetness&mdash;to consolation; but to every anguish,
every bitterness, for Love lives only by sacrifice; and the more a soul wills
to be surrendered to Love, the more must she be surrendered to suffering.</p>
<p align="center">HIST. D'UNE AME, CH. XII</p>
<br>
<p><font size="+3">I</font>N order to love Jesus, to be His victim of love,
the more weak and miserable we are, the more fitting are we for the
operations of this consuming and transforming Love . . . The sole desire to
be victim suffices; but we must consent to remain always poor and without
strength, and there lies the difficulty, for <i>where shall be found the
truly poor in spirit? He must be sought afar off</i>, <a href="#1-7">[7]</a>
saith the author of the <i>Imitation</i> . . . He did not say that we must
seek him amongst great souls, but afar off, that is to say in lowliness, in
nothingness . . . Oh! let us keep <i>afar off</i> from all that glitters, let
us love our littleness, and be satisfied to feel nothing, then shall we be
truly poor in spirit, and Jesus will come to seek us how far soever we may
be; He will transform us into flames of Love! . . .</p>

understood that the Church being a body composed of different members, the

I understood that the Church has <i>a heart</i> and that this heart is
burning with love; that it is love alone which makes the members work, that
if love were to die away apostles would no longer preach the Gospel, martyrs
would refuse to shed their blood. I understood that love comprises all
vocations, that love is everything, that it embraces all times and all places
because it is eternal!</p>

Yes, my Beloved, it is thus that my life's brief day shall be spent before
Thee. No other means have I of proving my love than to strew flowers; that
is, to let no little sacrifice escape me, not a look, not a word, to avail of
the very least actions and do them for Love. I wish to suffer for Love's sake
and for Love's sake even to rejoice; thus shall I strew flowers. Not one

often spoke of a well-known toy with which in childhood's days she had amused
herself: a kaleidoscope; in form somewhat like a small telescope; on looking
through, one sees an endless succession of pretty and many-coloured designs,
varying at each turn of the kaleidoscope.
</p><p>
"This toy," she said, "aroused my admiration and I used to wonder what could
produce so pleasing a phenomenon; when one day, after serious examination, I
saw there were simply a few tiny scraps of paper and of wool cut no matter
how, and thrown here and there. I pursued my investigation and discovered
three mirrors inside the tube: I had there the key to the problem.
</p><p>
"This was for me the image of a great mystery. As long as our actions, even
the least of them, remain within the focus of Love, the Blessed Trinity,
which is figured by the three mirrors, reflects them, and endows them with a
wondrous beauty. Jesus, looking at us through the little lens, that is to
say, as it were through Himself, finds all our actions pleasing to Him. But
if we leave the ineffable centre of Love, what will He see? Mere straws . . .
actions sullied and nothing worth."</p>

find one more weak than mine Thou wouldst take delight in showering upon her
greater favours still, provided that she abandoned herself with entire
confidence to Thine Infinite Mercy.
</p><p>
But why these desires, O my Beloved, to impart the secrets of Thy Love? Is it
not Thyself alone Who hast made them known to me and canst Thou not reveal
them to others? Yes, I know it and I implore Thee to <i>do</i> so: <i>I
beseech Thee to let Thy divine gaze rest upon an immense number of little

<p align="center">HIST. D'UNE AME, CH. XII</p>
<br>
<p><font size="+3">O</font> MY God, Most Blessed Trinity, I desire to love
Thee and to make Thee loved, to labour for the glory of Holy Church by saving
souls still on earth and by delivering those who suffer in purgatory. I
desire to accomplish Thy Will perfectly, and to attain to the degree of glory
which Thou hast prepared for me in Thy Kingdom, in one word, I desire to be a
saint, but I know that I am powerless, and I implore Thee, O my God, to be
Thyself my sanctity.
</p><p>
Since Thou hast so loved me as to give me Thine only Son to be my Saviour and
my Spouse, the infinite treasures of His merits are mine, to Thee I offer
them with joy, beseeching Thee to see me only as in the Face of Jesus and in
His Heart burning with Love.
</p><p>
Again, I offer Thee all the merits of the Saints&mdash;in Heaven and on
earth&mdash;their acts of love and those of the holy Angels; and finally I
offer Thee, O Blessed Trinity, the love and the merits of the Holy Virgin, my
most dear Mother; it is to her I entrust my oblation, begging her to present
it to Thee.
</p><p>
Her Divine Son, my well-beloved Spouse, during His life on earth, told us:
"<i>If you ask the Father anything in My Name He will give it to you.</i>" <a
href="#1-8">[8]</a> I am then certain that Thou wilt hearken to my desires .
. . My God, I know it, the more Thou willest to give the more dost Thou make
us desire. Immense are the desires that I feel within my heart, and it is
with confidence that I call upon Thee to come and take possession of my soul.
I cannot receive Thee in Holy Communion as often as I would; but, Lord, art
Thou not Almighty? . . . Remain in me as in the Tabernacle&mdash;never leave
Thy little Victim.
</p><p>
I long to console Thee for the ingratitude of the wicked and I pray Thee take
from me the liberty to displease Thee! If through frailty I fall sometimes,
may Thy Divine glance purify my soul immediately, consuming every
imperfection&mdash;like to fire which transforms all things into itself.
</p><p>
I thank Thee, O my God, for all the graces Thou hast bestowed on me, and
particularly for making me pass through the crucible of suffering. It is with
joy I shall behold Thee on the Last Day bearing Thy sceptre&mdash;the Cross;
since Thou hast deigned to give me for my portion this most precious Cross, I
have hope of resembling Thee in Heaven and seeing the sacred stigmata of Thy
Passion shine in my glorified body.
</p><p>
After exile on earth I hope to enjoy the possession of Thee in our eternal
Fatherland, but I have no wish to amass merits for Heaven, I will work for
Thy Love alone, my sole aim being to give Thee pleasure, to console Thy
Sacred Heart, and to save souls who will love Thee for ever.
</p><p>
At the close of life's evening I shall appear before Thee with empty hands,
for I ask not, Lord, that Thou wouldst count my works . . . All our justice
is tarnished in Thy sight. It is therefore my desire to be clothed with Thine
own Justice and to receive from Thy Love the eternal possession of Thyself. I
crave no other Throne nor other Crown but Thee, O my Beloved! . . .
</p><p>
In Thy sight time is nothing, one day is as a thousand years. 
<a href="#1-9">[9]</a> Thou canst in an instant prepare me to appear before Thee.
</p><p>
That I may live in one Act of perfect Love, I OFFER MYSELF AS A VICTIM OF
HOLOCAUST TO THY MERCIFUL LOVE, imploring Thee to consume me without ceasing,
and to let the tide of infinite tenderness pent up in Thee, overflow into my
soul, that so I may become a very martyr of Thy Love, O my God!
</p><p>
May this martyrdom, having first prepared me to appear before Thee, break
life's thread at last, and may my soul take its flight, <i>unretarded</i>,
into the eternal embrace of Thy Merciful Love.
</p><p>
I desire, O Well-Beloved, at every heart-beat to renew this Oblation an
infinite number of times, <i>till the shadows retire</i>
<a href="#1-10">[10]</a> and I can tell Thee my love eternally face to face!

<p><font size="+3">T</font>HERE are moments when we are so wretched within,
that we must needs hurry away from ourselves. The good God does not oblige us
to remain at such times in our own company; indeed He often permits that it
should be displeasing to us just that we may leave it. And I see no other
means of going out of ourselves than by going to visit Jesus and Mary, that
is, hastening to deeds of charity.</p>
<p align="center">COUNSELS AND REMINISCENCES</p>


<br>
<p><font size="+3">I</font> APPLIED myself above all to practise quite hidden
little acts of virtue; thus I liked to fold the mantles forgotten by the
Sisters, and sought a thousand opportunities of rendering them service.</p>
<p align="center">HIST. D'UNE AME, CH. VII</p>

<br>
<p><font size="+3">H</font>AD I been rich I never could have borne to see a
poor person hungry without giving him to eat. It is the same in my spiritual
life: knowing there are souls on the point of falling into Hell, I give them
my treasures according as I earn anything, and I have never yet found a
moment to say: "Now I am going to work for myself."</p>
<p align="center">COUNSELS AND REMINISCENCES</p>
<br>
<p><font size="+3">I</font> FEEL that when I am charitable it is Jesus alone
who acts in me; the more I am united to Him the more do I love all my
Sisters. If, when I desire to increase this love in my heart, the demon tries
to set before my eyes the faults of one or other of the Sisters, I hasten to
call to mind her virtues, her good desires; I say to myself that if I have
seen her fall once, she may well have gained many victories which she
conceals through humility; and that even what appears to me a fault may in
truth be an act of virtue by reason of the intention.</p>
<p align="center">HIST. D'UNE AME, CH. IX</p>
<br>
<p><font size="+3">T</font>RUE Charity consists in bearing with all the
defects of our neighbour, in not being surprised at his failings, and in
being edified by his least virtues; Charity must not remain shut up in the
depths of the heart, for <i>no man lighteth a candle and putteth it under a
bushel, but upon a candlestick, that it may shine to all that are in the
house.</i> <a href="#2-1">[1]</a> It seems to me that this candle represents
the Charity which ought to enlighten and make joyful, not only those who are
dearest to me, but <i>all who are in the house</i>. </p>
<p align="center">HIST. D'UNE AME, CH. IX</p>
<p><a name="2-1">[1]</a> <i>Cf</i>. Matt., v, 15.</p>
<br>
<p><font size="+3">T</font>THERE is no artist who does not like his work
praised, and the Divine Artist of souls is pleased when we do not stop at the
exterior, but penetrating even to the inmost sanctuary which He has chosen
for His dwelling, we admire its beauty.</p>
<p align="center">HIST. D'UNE AME, CH. IX</p>
<br>
<p><font size="+3">I</font> OUGHT to seek the company of those Sisters who
according to nature please me least. I ought to fulfil in their regard the
office of the Good Samaritan. A word, a kindly smile, will often suffice to
gladden a wounded and sorrowful heart.</p>
<p align="center">HIST. D'UNE AME, CH. X</p>
<br>
<p><font size="+3">O</font>H! what peace inundates the soul when she rises
above natural sentiment. No joy can compare with that known to one who is
truly poor in spirit. If he ask with detachment for some necessary thing, and
it is not only refused him, but an attempt made besides to deprive him of
what he already has, he follows the counsel of our Lord: "<i>And if a man
will contend with thee in judgment and take away thy coat, let go thy cloak
also unto him.</i>" <a href="#2-2">[2]</a>
</p><p>
To yield up our cloak means, I think, to renounce our last rights, to
consider oneself as the servant, the slave of others. When we have abandoned
our mantle it is easier to walk, to run; therefore Jesus adds: "<i>And
whosoever will force thee one mile, go with him other two</i>." 
<a href="#2-3">[3]</a>
</p><p>
It is not enough that I should give to whosoever may ask of me, I must
forestall their desires, and show that I feel much gratified, much honoured
in rendering service; and if they take a thing that I use, I must seem as
though glad to be relieved of it.</p>

what we give Him from our heart, and the very least trifle is precious in His
sight. He stretches forth His Hand, this sweet Saviour, to receive of us a
little love, so that in the radiant day of Judgment He may be able to address
to us those ineffable words: "<i>Come, ye blessed of My Father; for I was
hungry, and you gave Me to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave Me to drink; I
was a stranger, and you took Me in; sick and you visited Me; I was in prison,
and you came to Me.</i>" <a href="#2-5">[5]</a></p>

<p><font size="+3">I</font>F I were still to live, the office of Infirmarian

direct by obedience I should think myself highly privileged. It seems to me
that I would discharge its duties with a tender love, thinking always of our
Saviour saying: "<i>I was sick and you visited me.</i>" <a href="#2-6">[6]</a> 
The Infirmary bell should be for you as Heavenly music. You ought
purposely to pass along beneath the windows of the sick to give them facility
in calling you and asking your services. Ought you not to consider yourself
like a little slave whom everyone has a right to command? If you could but
see the Angels who from the heights of Heaven watch you battling in the
arena! They await the end of the combat to cover you with flowers and
wreaths. The good God does not disdain these combats, unknown and therefore
all the more meritorious. "<i>The patient man is better than the valiant, and
he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh cities.</i>" <a href="#2-7">[7]</a>

is God's will that in this world by means of prayer Heavenly treasures should
be imparted by souls one to another, so that when they reach the Fatherland

far, far exceeding the most ideal family affection upon earth.

owe to quite little souls, will love them with an incomparable love?

of it. The favoured companion of an Apostle or a great Doctor of the Church,

in the middle of the most interesting passage.</p>
<p align="center">HIST. D'UNE AME, CH. IV</p>

<br>
<p><font size="+3">I</font> WAS ten years old the day that my Father told
C&#233;line he was going to let her have lessons in painting; I was by, and
envied her. Then Papa said to me: "And you, my little queen, would it give
you pleasure too to learn drawing?" I was just going to respond with a very
gladsome <i>yes</i>, when Marie made the remark that I had not the same taste
for it as C&#233;line. At once she gained the day; and I, thinking that here
was a good opportunity of offering a grand sacrifice to Jesus, said not a
word. So eager was my desire to learn drawing that now I still wonder how I
had the fortitude to remain silent.</p>

think over what would probably occur either pleasing or vexatious during the

the other way: I think of the difficulties and the sufferings that await me,
and I rise the more joyous and full of courage the more I foresee
opportunities of proving my love for Jesus, and <i>earning the living of my
children</i>&mdash;seeing that I am <i>the mother</i> of souls. Then I kiss
my crucifix and lay it tenderly on the pillow while I dress, and I say to
Him: "My Jesus, Thou hast worked enough and wept enough during the three-and-
thirty years of Thy life on this poor earth. Take now Thy rest . . . My turn
it is to suffer and to fight."</p>
<p align="center">COUNSELS AND REMINISCENCES</p>
<br>
<p><font size="+3">T</font>HE attraction to penance was given me, but I was
permitted nothing to satisfy it. The only mortifications I was allowed

penance.</p>
<p align="center">HIST. D'UNE AME, CH. VII</p>
<br>
<p><font size="+3">A</font>T prayer I was for a long time near a Sister who
used to handle incessantly either her Rosary-beads or some other thing;
perhaps none heard it but myself, for my hearing is extremely acute, but I
cannot say how it tormented me! I should have liked to turn my head and look
at the culprit so as to make her stop that noise: however in my heart I knew
it was better to bear it patiently, for the love of God in the first place,
and also to avoid giving pain.
</p><p>
I kept quiet therefore, but was sometimes worked up to fever-heat and obliged
to make simply a prayer of endurance. Finally I sought out the means of
suffering with peace and joy, at least in my innermost soul; I tried to like
the teasing little noise. Instead of endeavouring not to hear it&mdash;a
thing impossible&mdash;I listened with fixed attention as if it had been a
delightful concert; and my prayer, <i>which was not the prayer of quiet</i>,
passed in offering this concert to Jesus.
</p><p>
Another time I was in the laundry opposite a Sister who while washing
handkerchiefs splashed me every minute with dirty water. My first impulse was
to draw back and wipe my face, so as to show her who besprinkled me in that
fashion, that she would oblige me by working more quietly; but I reflected
immediately that it was very foolish to refuse treasures so generously
offered me, and I took good care not to show my annoyance. On the contrary, I
made such successful efforts to <i>wish</i> for a plentiful splashing of
dirty water, that at the end of half an hour I had really acquired a taste
for this new sort of aspersion, and I determined to come again as often as
possible to a place where happily such riches could be had gratuitously.</p>

<p><font size="+3">I</font> REMEMBER that sometimes, when a postulant, I was
so violently tempted to indulge myself by seeking some little consolations,
that I was obliged to go quickly past our Mother's cell, and cling to the
banisters of the staircase so that I should not turn back. There would come
to mind a number of permissions to ask, a hundred pretexts for deciding in
favour of my natural inclinations and gratifying them. How glad I am now of
having denied myself from the outset of my life in religion! Already I enjoy
the reward promised to those who fight courageously. No longer do I feel the
necessity of refusing myself consolations of the heart; for my heart is
firmly fixed in God . . . Because it has loved Him above all, it has
gradually enlarged, even so as to love those who are dear to it with a love
incomparably deeper than if it were centred in a selfish and fruitless
affection.</p>

<p><font size="+3">I</font>N everything I must find self-denial and
sacrifice; thus I feel that a letter will not bear fruit unless I write it
with a certain reluctance, and solely through obedience. When conversing with
a novice I am careful to mortify myself and to avoid asking her questions
which would gratify my curiosity. If she commence to speak of something
interesting, then, leaving it unfinished, pass to a subject wearisome to me,
I take care not to remind her of the interruption, for it seems to me that
one can do no good by self-seeking.</p>

difficulty that I recalled to mind, at eight o'clock in the evening, what I
had composed in the morning.

<i>lift</i>, the object of my desires; and I read these words which have
issued from the very mouth of the Eternal Wisdom: <i>"Whosoever is a</i> VERY
LITTLE ONE, <i>let him come to me."</i> <a href="#10-1">[1]</a> Then I drew
nigh unto God divining truly that I had discovered what I sought: wishing
however to know what He would do with the very little one, I continued my
research and here is what I found: <i>"You shall be carried at the breast and
upon the knees; as one whom the mother caresseth so will I comfort you."</i>
<a href="#10-2">[2]</a>
</p><p>
Ah, never came words more sweet, more tender, to gladden my soul. Thine arms
then, O Jesus, are the <i>lift</i> which must raise me up even unto Heaven!
For this I need not grow, on the contrary I must remain little, I must ever
tend to become yet more little. O my God, Thou hast gone beyond my
expectations, and I&mdash;I will sing Thy mercies! <i>Thou hast taught me, O

and my confidence. Justice not merely exercises severity towards the
offender; it moreover recognizes a right intention, and awards to virtue its
recompense. I hope as much from the Justice of the good God as from His
Mercy; it is because He is just, that <i>"He is compassionate and merciful,
long-suffering and plenteous in mercy. For He knoweth our frame. He

His children who have loved Him even unto sacrificing all for Him, who have
not only left their kindred and their country, for the sake of making Him
known and loved, but, still further, desire to give their life for Him? . . .
Most truly has Jesus said that there is no greater love than this! How then
could He suffer Himself to be outdone in generosity? How could He purify in
the flames of Purgatory souls consumed by the fire of Divine Love? . . .

comparison how much Jesus loves souls, even the imperfect, who trust in Him.
Suppose the father of two wayward and disobedient children, coming to punish
them, sees one tremble and draw away from him in terror; while the other, on
the contrary, throwing himself into his arms, says he is sorry, promises to
be good henceforward and begs for a kiss as punishment. Do you think the
delighted father will withstand the filial confidence of this child? He knows
nevertheless that his son will fall again many a time into the same faults,
but he is disposed to pardon him always, if always there be an appeal to his
heart.

love him as much or treat him with the same indulgence.</p>

thousand little imperfections of His friends than by even grave faults of His
enemies. But it seems to me that it is only when His own chosen ones make a
habit of these infidelities, and do not ask His pardon, that He can say:
<i>"These wounds which you see in the midst of My Hands: with these was I
wounded in the house of them that loved Me."</i> <a href="#10-6">[6]</a>
</p><p>
For those who love Him and who come after each little fault and throw
themselves into His arms, begging His forgiveness, the Heart of Jesus thrills
with joy. He says to His Angels what the father of the prodigal son said to
His servants: <i>"Put a ring on his finger and let us rejoice."</i> <a

The father having learnt that there lies in his son's way a dangerous stone,
sets out beforehand and removes it unseen by anyone. His son, the object of
this tender forethought, unaware of the misfortune from which he has been
preserved by the father's hand, will of course show no gratitude, and will
love him less than if he had cured him of a grievous wound. But should he

should love Him because He has forgiven me, not <i>much</i>, but

her sisters, Th&#233;r&#232;se paused to enjoy the fascinating sight of a
little white hen sheltering its chickens beneath its wings. Very soon her
eyes filled with tears, and turning to her dear companion she said: "I can
stay no longer, let us go in again quickly. . ." And in her cell, her tears
continued falling and she could not utter a word. At last, looking at her
sister with an expression that was quite heavenly, she said:
</p><p>
"I was thinking of our Lord, and of the touching comparison He chose in order
to make us believe in His tenderness. That is just what He has done for me
all my life: <i>He has wholly hidden me beneath His wings!</i> I cannot
express what passed within my heart. Ah! the good God does well to veil
Himself from my sight, to show me the effects of His Mercy rarely, and as it
were, <i>'through the lattices;'</i> <a href="#12-4">[4]</a> such

not then necessary to say: In drawing me, draw the souls whom I love. These,
simple words: <i>"Draw me"</i> suffice! Yes, when a soul has allowed herself

become identified with the fire even so far as to share its substance? Well,
that is exactly my prayer. I beg of Jesus to draw me into the flames of His
Love, to unite me so closely to Himself that He may live and act in me. I

Archimedes said: "Give me a lever and a fulcrum, and I will raise the world."
What he was unable to obtain because his request had but a material end and
was not addressed to God, the Saints have obtained in full measure. For
fulcrum, the Almighty has given them Himself, Himself alone! for lever,
prayer, which enkindles the fire of love; and thus it is that they have
uplifted the world, thus it is that saints still militant, uplift it, and
will uplift it till the end of time.</p>

"A few days after my oblation to <i>God's Merciful Love</i>," she relates, "I
had commenced in the Choir the Way of the Cross, when I felt myself suddenly
wounded by a dart of fire so ardent that I thought I must die. I know not how
to describe this transport; there is no comparison which would make one
understand the intensity of that flame. An invisible power seemed to plunge
me wholly into fire . . . but oh! what fire! what sweetness!"
</p><p>
The Mother Prioress asked her whether this transport was the first in her
life, she answered simply:
</p><p>
"Mother, I have several times had transports of love; once especially during
my novitiate when I remained one entire week far indeed from this world; for
me, there was as it were, a veil thrown over all things of the earth. But I
was not consumed by a real flame, I was able to sustain those delights
without expecting that their intensity would cause my earthly fetters to snap
asunder, whilst on the day of which I speak, one minute, one second more and
my soul must have left its prison . . . Alas!&mdash;and I found myself again
on earth, and aridity immediately returned to my heart!"</p>

<p><font size="+3">H</font>OW sweet it was, the first kiss of Jesus to my
soul! Yes, it was a kiss of Love. I felt I was loved, and I too said: "I love
Thee, I give myself to Thee for ever!" Jesus asked nothing of me, demanded no
sacrifice. Already for a long time past, He and the little Th&#233;r&#232;se
had watched and understood one another . . . That day our meeting was no
longer a simple look but a <i>fusion</i>. No longer were we two:
Th&#233;r&#232;se had disappeared as the drop of water which loses itself in
the depths of the ocean, Jesus alone remained; the Master, the King! Had not
Th&#233;r&#232;se begged Him to take away from her, her liberty? That liberty
made her afraid; so weak, so fragile did she feel herself that she longed to
be united for ever to Divine Strength.</p>

<p><font size="+3">I</font> HAD taken as my rule of conduct, to receive most
faithfully Holy Communion as often as my confessor permitted, without ever
asking that it might be more frequent. I would act differently now; for I am
quite sure that a soul ought to make known to her director the attraction
that she feels to receive her God. It is not to remain in a golden ciborium
that He comes down each day from Heaven, but to find another Heaven, the
Heaven of our soul in which He takes His delight.</p>

for my own satisfaction, but solely for His pleasure.
</p><p>
I imagine my soul to be as a plot of waste ground and beg the Blessed Virgin
to remove from it all the rubbish&mdash;meaning its imperfections; then I
beseech her to erect thereon, a vast canopy worthy of Heaven and to decorate
it with her own treasures, and I invite all the Angels and Saints to come and
sing canticles of love. It seems to me then that Jesus is pleased to see
Himself so magnificently received; and I, I share His joy. All this does not
hinder distractions and sleep from molesting me; therefore it not rarely
happens that I resolve to continue my thanksgiving all the day long, since I
have made it so badly in the Choir.</p>

my soul under the figure of a little child of three or four years, who at
play has got its hair tossed and its clothes soiled.&mdash;These misfortunes
have befallen me in battling with souls.&mdash;But very soon the Blessed
Virgin hastens to my aid: quickly she takes off my little dirty pinafore,
smooths my hair and adorns it with a pretty ribbon or simply with a little
flower . . . and this suffices to render me pleasing and enables me to sit at
the Banquet of Angels without blushing.</p>

something further, he wants to deprive Jesus of a loved tabernacle. Not being
able himself to enter into this sanctuary he wishes that it may at least
remain empty and without its Lord. Alas! what will become of this poor heart?

<p><a name="17-1">[1]</a> No reader should be discouraged by this chapter on
Suffering. What S&oelig;ur Th&#233;r&#232;se says is very consoling for those
who are nailed to the Cross; and others must remember that God had given to
His humble Servant a <i>sensible</i> attraction for suffering, which is a
rare grace and reserved to very few souls, though many imagine they possess
it, and mistake their road choosing to follow this supposed attraction.
Without the sensible desire and even though experiencing an invincible
repugnance to suffer, souls can be sanctified. What pleases God is that the
suffering be borne with love.

<br>
<p><font size="+3">O</font>NE day my sister Marie, speaking of suffering,
said that instead of making me walk by that way, the good God would no doubt
carry me always like a little child. These words recurred to me after Holy
Communion on the following day, and my heart was fired with an ardent desire
of suffering. I felt too an inward assurance, that crosses in great number
were in reserve for me. Then my soul was inundated with consolations such as
I have never had again in all my life. Suffering became my attraction, in it
I found charms that entranced me.
</p><p>
Another great desire that I felt, was to love but God alone and to find no
joy save only in Him. Often during my thanksgiving after Holy Communion I
used to repeat this passage from the <i>Imitation: "O Jesus, who art
ineffable sweetness, turn for me into bitterness all the consolations of
earth."</i> <a href="#17-2">[2]</a> These words came from my lips without
effort; I uttered them like a child who repeats without too well

we want to attain an end we must employ the means, and Jesus having made me
understand that He would give me souls by means of the cross, the more
crosses I met with the more my attraction to suffering increased. During five
years this way was mine; but I alone knew it. Here was just the hidden flower

which any impression may be stamped the bad, alas! like the good; and I
understood those words of Jesus: "<i>But he that shall scandalize one of
these little ones . . . it were better for him that a millstone were hanged
about his neck and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea</i>." <a
href="#18-1">[1]</a> Oh! how many souls might attain to a high degree of
holiness if wisely guided from the very first.
</p><p>
I well know that to accomplish His work of sanctification, God has need of no
one, but just as He enables a skilful gardener to rear plants that are
delicate and rare, granting him for this end all the knowledge necessary,
while reserving to Himself the care of giving the increase, so, too, does He
will to be aided in His divine culture of souls.</p>

<br>
<p><font size="+3">A</font>S soon as I penetrated into the sanctuary of souls
I judged at the first glance that the task exceeded my powers, and very
quickly placing myself in the arms of the good God I imitated the little
child, who, seized with sudden fear, tries to hide its golden head on its
father's shoulder, and I said: "Lord, Thou knowest it, I am myself too little
to be capable of nurturing these Thy children; if Thou dost will to give to
them, through me, what is suited to each one, fill Thou my little hand, and
without leaving Thine arms, without even turning my head aside, I will
distribute Thy treasures to the souls who come to me to seek sustenance. When
they find it to their liking I shall know that it is not to me they owe it
but to Thee; on the other hand if they complain, and find bitter what I offer
them, my peace shall remain undisturbed, I will try to convince them that
this nutriment comes from Thee, and I will carefully refrain from seeking any
other for them."
</p><p>
When I thus understood that it was impossible for me to do anything by
myself, the task appeared to me simplified. Interiorly, I occupied myself
solely in trying to become more and more united to God&mdash;knowing that the
rest would be added unto me.</p>

<p><font size="+3">F</font>ROM afar it seems easy to do good to souls, to
make them love God more, to mould them after our own views and opinions. But
coming closer one feels, on the contrary, that to do good without the divine
assistance, is as impossible a thing as to bring the sun back after it has
set. One feels that it is absolutely necessary to forget our own
inclinations, our personal notions, and to guide souls, not by our own
way&mdash;the way we ourselves go&mdash;but by the particular way that Jesus
wishes to lead them.</p>

was given to me to read. In one of the stories I saw that the mistress of a
school was much praised because she knew how to get on cleverly in the world
without offending anyone. This phrase I remarked especially: "She would say
to the one, 'You are not wrong,' and to the other, 'You are right;" and while
I read I was thinking: "Oh! . . . I would not have acted thus; we must always
tell the truth." And so I do, always. Far more difficult it certainly is, for
when told of some little vexatious occurrence, it would be easy to lay blame
on the absent, and she who complains would at once be pacified. Yes, but . .
. I do quite the reverse. If I am not liked, what matter! Let no one come to
me who does not want to hear the truth.</p>

One must not let kindness degenerate into weakness. When we have blamed
justly we ought to leave it so, and not yield to feelings of distress at
having given pain. To run after the aggrieved one in order to console her, is
to do more harm than good. To leave her to herself is to force her to expect
nothing from creatures, to have recourse to the good God, to see her failings
and to humble herself. Otherwise she would grow accustomed to being consoled
after a deserved rebuke and would behave as does a spoilt child, who stamps
and cries, well knowing that this will make its mother return to wipe away
the tears.</p>

This trait of my childhood is, as it were, a summary of my entire life. Later
on when the meaning of perfection began to unfold itself to me, I understood
that to become a saint it is necessary to suffer much, ever to seek after
that which is most perfect, and to forget self. I understood that in sanctity
the degrees are many, that each soul is free to respond to the advances of
our Lord, to do little or much for His sake, in a word, to choose between the
sacrifices that He asks. Then, as in the days of my childhood, I exclaimed:
"My God, I choose all! I do not wish to be a saint by halves; the thought of
suffering for Thee does not frighten me, one thing only do I fear&mdash;my
own will; take Thou my will, for <i>I choose all</i> that Thou willest."</p>

most part, instead of recognizing the value of the Cross, meet it with
repining and with tears; and would you behave like the generality of people?
. . . Frankly that is not disinterested love&mdash;disinterested love is
<i>for us to console Jesus, not for Him to console us.</i>
</p><p>
"He is, I know, so kind of heart that if you weep He will dry your tears; but
afterwards He will go away quite sorrowful, not being able to find in you the
repose He sought. Jesus loves the joyous heart, He loves the ever smiling
soul. When will you learn to <i>hide</i> your troubles from Him, or to tell
Him in gladsome tones that you are happy to suffer for His sake?"</p>

<br>
<p><font size="+3">A</font> SISTER, greatly grieved at seeing her so ill
often exclaimed: "Oh, how sad is life!" But S&oelig;ur Th&#233;r&#232;se
would at once correct her, saying:
</p><p>
"Life is not sad, but on the contrary most joyful. If you said 'How sad is
our exile,' I should understand you. It is erroneous to give the name,
'<i>life</i>,' to that which must end. Only to the things of Heaven, to that
which shall never know death, should the true name of '<i>life</i>' be given;
and in this signification life is not sad but joyful&mdash;joyous
exceedingly! . . . "
</p><p>
Her own gaiety was delightful to witness.
</p><p>
For several days she had been much better and the novices said to her: "We do
not yet know of what malady you will die . . . "
</p><p>
"But I shall die of <i>death!</i> Did not God tell Adam of what he would die,
saying to him: Thou shalt die of death?" (In the French: "<i>Tu mourras de
mort</i>.") <a href="#20-16">[16]</a></p>

nothing, for that would be to depart from my way of abandonment, I merely beg

which He gives Himself in the holy Gospel, so that He may not forget to come

<p>[Transcriber's Note: Sister Th&#233;r&#232;se was beatified on April 29,
1923.]</p>
<p><font size="+3">O</font> JESUS, who, to put our pride to confusion didst
will to become a little child, and who later pronounced that solemn decree:
"<i>Unless ye become as little children ye shall not enter the Kingdom of
Heaven</i>," deign to listen to our humble prayer in regard to her who lived
perfectly that life of spiritual childhood, and who has so well recalled to
us the way.
</p><p>
O little Babe of Bethlehem, by the ineffable charms of Thy Divine Infancy, O
adorable Face of Jesus, by the humiliations of Thy Passion, we implore, that
if it be for the glory of God and for the sanctification of souls, the halo
of the Blessed may soon irradiate the pure brow of Thy childlike spouse,
Th&#233;r&#232;se of the Child Jesus and of the Holy Face.
</p><p>
O God, who didst inflame with Thy Spirit of Love the soul of Thy Servant,
Th&#233;r&#232;se of the Child Jesus, grant that we also may love Thee and
may make Thee greatly loved.
